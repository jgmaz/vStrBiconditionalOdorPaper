# vStrBiconditionalOdorPaper

This repository hosts the code used for Gmaz & van der Meer, "Context coding in the mouse nucleus accumbens modulates motivationally-relevant information" ([Preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.24.449720v3)).

See [here](https://gin.g-node.org/jgmaz/BiconditionalOdor) for the associated data.

Makes use of the [vandermeerlab codebase](https://github.com/vandermeerlab/vandermeerlab), as well as the Machens lab [dPCA toolbox](https://github.com/machenslab/dPCA) from [Kobak et al. 2016](https://elifesciences.org/articles/10989).

For figures related to behavioral performance (Figure 1, S1), see the genBeh workflow in the Behavior folder.

For figures related to firing rate analysis (Figures 2, 3, 4, S2), see the genFR workflow in the Firing rates folder.

For figures related to population-level analysis (Figures 4, 7, 8, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7), see the gendPCA workflow in the Population activity folder.
